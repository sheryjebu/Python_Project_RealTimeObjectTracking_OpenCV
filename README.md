Common Intelligence Platform (CIP) for Robotics – Real Time Object Tracking Using Stereoscopic Camera

#Research Question
    Tracking objects in real-time or video is essential for security surveillance, pattern and motion
    recognition, traffic management, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, and more.
    Despite the rapid growth of various methods in recent years, there are still certain technical
    challenges in terms of efficiency. , accuracy and quality. strength. However, despite recent
    advances in the -related literature, object recognition still remains a challenge in computer vision.
    This Project aims to develop a prototype for programming robots in a Single Robotic Platform,
    which is common for all types of robots. My main project is focused on developing a Common
    Intelligence Platform for Robotic Programming (CIP) that focus on the development of the Real
    Time Object Tracking using Stereoscopic Camera for Robotics.

#Research Methodology
   * This Project aims to develop a prototype for programming robots in a Single Robotic Platform, which is common for all types of robots, which I am calling it as CIP or Common Intelligence Platform for Robotics.
   * Here my focus is to development  a Real Time Object Tracking using Stereoscopic Camera. The figure here shows the design of CIP.
   * Implementation of computer vision, the objective is to develop a program that can detect an object, recognise an object and track object coordinate using stereoscopic vision.
   * This project is developed using Python Programming Language and implementing Open CV and applying the Computer Vision and deep learning algorithms Like YOLOV(You Only Look Once) trained models using COCO dataset. 
     Also 2 HD Webcam setting.
   * Using Development methodology using Bio-inspired approach.
>> Python programming Language  3.10 version , IDE – PyCharm 2021.3.2 (Community Edition)
>> Implementation of  Open CV and applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning algorithm YOLO ( You Only Look Once ) trained model.
